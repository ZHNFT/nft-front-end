                            <h5>PALM SPRINGS, Calif., May 16, 2022 (Newswire.com) -</h5>

                            <p>BluChip today introduced its unique platform enabling the
                                purchase of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are
                                tethered to an original fine art painting or sculpture. With this
                                ability, NFTs now have actual physical value specific to worldclass artwork, making them more valuable than ever, while
                                elevating the NFT marketplace as an attractive option for
                                serious art collectors, investors and savvy traders. This
                                innovative BluChip NFT Marketplace allows art collectors,
                                cryptocurrency investors, digital asset speculators and others
                                to access valuable NFT assets that can uniquely be swapped
                                at any time for the actual artwork the NFT represents — all via a powerful, immutable Smart Contract                                on the blockchain.

                            </p>
                            <p>Auctions for various BluChip NFTs will take place at www.BluChipNFT.co beginning on May 23, 2022.
                                BluChip's unique Smart Contract technology enables bidders to bid on swappable NFTs that only the
                                winning bidder can exchange to own a highly valuable, very sought-after masterpiece. With a digital
                                token that ties BluChip's NFTs to the genuine artwork, the NFT can simply be swapped out to receive
                                the actual real-life museum-quality masterwork. However, unlike a traditional art sale, one does not
                                need to have a place to relocate their masterpiece until one is ready to swap their BluChip NFT for
                                the fine art.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Notably, the BluChip NFT Marketplace features some of the most exciting collectible artists, in which
                                their artwork is rarely found for purchase. The presence of names such as Andy Warhol, Keith Haring
                                and Banksy are certain to capture the attention of art aficionados, and it's expected that many of
                                them will be first-time NFT buyers.
                            </p>

                                The NFT art market has recently exploded on the scene as the latest, investment-grade digital asset.
                                As many forms of intellectual property migrate to the blockchain, the benefits can be innumerable.
                                These one-of-a-kind digital assets can exist with proven scarcity, ownership and smart contract
                                intelligence. Parasitic extractions along the value chain are eliminated. Instead, direct-to-market
                                ownership, trading and tracking will enable marketplaces to flourish without needing any
                                intermediaries, counterparty risk or the costs associated with having traditional IP management.</p>

                            <p>The NFT art market has proven to be an outstanding part of the digital asset marketplace. The single
                                biggest challenge thus far has been bridging digital blockchain assets with physical assets. There is
                                just no way to actually put a physical painting on the blockchain. Enter the new era of swappable
                                BluChip NFTs, which provide a token that holds a unique claim on a physical asset in exchange for the
                                digital asset. Cryptographically enforced, these swappable BluChip NFTs hold exclusive claim to actual
                                museum-quality BluChip artwork.</p>

                            <p>A double entry accounting concept is created, whereby the digital asset and physical asset each can
                                hold a unique value to the market. These two assets - one digital, one physical - are inextricably
                                linked via Solana, which is a decentralized blockchain that tracks digital assets with Smart Contract
                                governance and provable ownership. The buyer of exclusive BluChip NFTs will hold the exclusive
                                rights to control the original artwork and speculate on the digital asset token representing that
                                artwork. The owner of a BluChip NFT controls which side of the transaction suits them best; the digital token or the physical artwork because it is swappable without counterparty risk.
                            </p>
                            <p>This innovation solves a major issue that has impeded the adoption of NFTs for many qualified
                                investors, collectors and financially savvy traders. By bridging this gap between two established asset
                                classes, BluChip NFT auctions brings a unique opportunity to acquire assets that connect with highly
                                sought-after BluChip artwork rarely owned outside of museums. By providing the BluChip art market
                                with swappable BluChip NFTs connected to genuine pieces of BluChip artworks, the demand and
                                liquidity for BluChip art will increase and gain efficiency to find the strongest stakeholders in the
                                market.

                            <p>The History of Swappable NFTs</p>
                            <p>G. Thomas Kerr is the president of ArtCoins International, and the visionary behind its new BluChip
                                division of swappable NFTs. Kerr has been in the cryptocurrency market and has a deep appreciation
                                for the arts, but also has a finance and tech background.
                            </p>

                            <p>"I was interested in finding a way to link the two asset classes together: fine art and digital assets, the
                                swappable NFT does just that by enabling the marketplace to decide value and provide better price
                                discovery for each asset class," Kerr noted in his presentation to stakeholders. As such, ArtCoins
                                International has partnered with the Musee d' Art Moderne to auction over 100 great Masterworks,
                                including masterpieces by Banksy, Basquiat, Rothko, and Haring to mint as swappable NFTs — all
                                select works from its exclusive private museum collection.
                            </p>
                            <p>This proven history of art acquisitions and high-end fine art sales led Kerr to consider the latest
                                technology's role in helping to create a new generation of art fans. "With so many people that have
                                already gotten interested in NFTs, it simply made sense to tie digital masterpieces to their physical
                                origins," added Kerr. "BluChip's goal is to make real-life fine art more accessible, and swappable NFTs
                                are expected to become a big piece this new digital art renaissance."</p>
                            <p>One-of-a-Kind Digital Assets</p>
                            <p>Another value-add of NFTs is their level of exclusivity. Some artists will create a limited-edition series
                                that contains multiple versions of the same thing. But for the most part, NFTs aren't duplicated,
                                which really drives up consumer interest in buying them. However, some people have been hesitant
                                to use their cryptocurrency on products that have no physical representation. When traditional NFTs
                                are purchased, a digital asset only is provided, with ownership over it, but that doesn't stop anyone
                                else in the world from copying it and sharing it.
                            </p>
                            <p>One of the biggest advantages is having a digital token that can be exchanged for a real, one-of-akind piece of art. Your BluChip NFT's value of the fine art isn't attached to the Solana blockchain or
                                cryptocurrency, so even if your digital art were to lose market demand, the digital token can be
                                traded back to BluChip's wallet to redeem the actual physical piece of art. Therefore, if one
                                purchased Banksy's Mighty Mouse, possession of the physical piece can be taken at any time, which
                                protects your investment no matter what happens in the NFT digital marketplace, you get the
                                genuine artwork to keep.</p>

                            <p>Here, two auctions are already planned to include very rare original stencil masterworks by Bansky.
                                His career has captivated people worldwide. Recent auction sale of the "Shredded Banksy" exceeded
                                $25 million at Sotheby's. His artwork has shown an appreciable value over the years, and there is no
                                sign of this trend stopping. Hence, this makes BluChip NFTs a smart investment for art collectors.
                                After all, there will be no other way to purchase an original Banksy of Mighty Mouse or Wicked Trump
                                Player.
