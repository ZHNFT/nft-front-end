                            <h5>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h5>
                            <p><b>By determining to use the BluChip NFT Marketplace (hereafter “Company”) website, auction trading platform, and any other associated digital assets or platforms (hereafter “Platforms”), the terms (hereafter “Terms”) stated on this page will automatically apply to the user of the Company website (hereafter “User”). Therefore, the User should read the Terms carefully before using our Platforms.</b></p>
                            <p>The User is not allowed to copy, or modify the Platform, any part of the Platform, or our trademarks in any way. The User is not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the Platform. The User must not translate the Platform into other languages, or make derivative versions, for profit or otherwise. The Company itself, and all the trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to the Company.</p>
                            <p>The Company is committed to ensuring that the Platform is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the Platform, or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge the User for the Company or its services without acting upon an obligation for describing the reason for such decisions are made.</p>

                            <h5>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & ASSOCIATED RIGHTS</h5>
                            <p>To reiterate, the Platforms and its entire contents, features and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the design, selection and arrangement thereof), are owned by ArtCoins International, its licensors or other providers of such material and are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.</p>
                            <p>Jailbreaking or rooting the device could make the User’s phone/computer vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise the User’s phone’s/computer’s security features, and possibly mean that the Platforms will not work properly – or at all – on the device.</p>
                            <p>Users are responsible for:</p>
                            <ul className="">
                                <li>Making all arrangements necessary for Users to have access to the Platforms.</li>
                                <li>Ensuring that all persons who access the Platforms through their internet</li>
                                <li>connection is aware of these Terms and comply with them.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>To access the Platforms or some of the resources it offers, Users may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of their use of the Platforms that all the information Users provide on the Platforms is correct, current and complete.</p>
                            <p>Users also agree that all information they provide to register using this Website or otherwise, including, but not limited to, using any interactive features on the Website, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and Users consent to all actions we take with respect to User information consistent with our Privacy Policy.</p>
                            <p>Users should use particular caution when inputting personal information on to the Platforms on a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view, or record said personal information.</p>

                            <h5>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h5>
                            <p>The Company does use third-party services that have their own terms and conditions. Here is a list of links to the Company’s third-party service providers:<a href="https://www.binance.com" target="_blank">Scalable Blockchain Infrastructure: Billions of transactions & counting | Solana: Build crypto apps that scale</a> (SOL), and <a href="https://www.binance.com" target="_blank">https://www.binance.com</a>.</p>
                            <p>The User should be aware that there are certain things the Company will not take responsibility for. For example, certain functions of the Platforms will require the Platforms to have an active Internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by the User’s mobile network provider, but the Company cannot take responsibility for the Platforms not working at full functionality if the User does not have access to Wi-Fi or their network data.</p>

                            <h5>MOBILE CARRIER TERMS & CONDITIONS</h5>
                            <p>If the User is using the Platforms outside of an area with Wi-Fi, the User should remember that their service carrier’s terms of agreement will still apply. As a result, the User may be charged by their cellular service provider for the cost of data for the duration of accessing the Platforms, or any applicable third-party charges.</p>

                            <p>Along the same lines, the Company cannot always take responsibility for the way the User uses the Platforms, i.e., the User needs to make sure that their device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and the User cannot turn it on to use the Platforms, the Company cannot be held responsible for that.</p>

                            <p>With respect to the Company’s responsibility for the User’s use of the Company, when the User is using the Company, it is important to bear in mind that, although we endeavor to ensure the Company is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to the User. The Company accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that the User experiences as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the Platforms.</p>

                            <h5>PLATFORM UPDATES</h5>
                            <p>At some point, we may wish to update the Platforms. The Website is currently available on the World Wide Web.</p>

                            <p>The Company does not promise that it will always update the Website so that it is relevant to the User and/or works with the browser – or version of operating system – that the User has installed on their device.</p>

                            <p>However, the User promises to always accept updates to the Platforms when offered. We may also wish to stop providing the Platforms services and may terminate their use at any time without giving notice of termination to the User. Unless we tell the User otherwise, upon any termination the rights and licenses granted to the User in the Terms will end.</p>

                            <h5>CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h5>
                            <p>We may update the Terms from time to time. Thus, the User is advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify the User of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page.</p>

                            <h5>CONTACT US</h5>
                            <p>If the User has any questions or suggestions about our Terms, they may contact us at: <a href="/contactus" >here</a></p>
